### Explain all about joins in SQL

  > **JOINING TABLES:**
  > 
  > 1. All RDBMS are relational in nature, where tables are referenced to obtain meaningful outcomes.
  > 
  > 2. Foreign keys (FK) are used to reference other tables.
  > 
  > 3. **INNER JOIN:**
  >    - Returns a resultant table with matching values from both tables.
  >    - Syntax:
  >      ```
  >      SELECT column-list FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON condition1
  >      INNER JOIN table3 ON condition2 ...;
  >      ```
  > 
  > 4. **Alias in MySQL (AS):**
  >    - Provides a temporary name to tables or columns in a query for readability.
  >    - Example:
  >      ```
  >      SELECT col_name AS alias_name FROM table_name;
  >      SELECT col_name1, col_name2,... FROM table_name AS alias_name;
  >      ```
  > 
  > 5. **OUTER JOIN:**
  >    - **LEFT JOIN:**
  >      - Returns all data from the left table and matched data from the right table.
  >      - Example:
  >        ```
  >        SELECT columns FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON Join_Condition;
  >        ```
  >    - **RIGHT JOIN:**
  >      - Returns all data from the right table and matched data from the left table.
  >      - Example:
  >        ```
  >        SELECT columns FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON join_cond;
  >        ```
  >    - **FULL JOIN:**
  >      - Returns all data when there is a match in either left or right table data.
  >      - Emulated using LEFT JOIN UNION RIGHT JOIN.
  > 
  > 6. **UNION ALL vs UNION:**
  >    - **UNION ALL:** Includes duplicate values.
  >    - **UNION:** Provides unique values.
  > 
  > 7. **CROSS JOIN:**
  >    - Returns the Cartesian product of data from both tables.
  >    - Example:
  >      ```
  >      SELECT column-lists FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;
  >      ```
  > 
  > 8. **SELF JOIN:**
  >    - Used to join a table to itself to retrieve related data.
  >    - Example:
  >      ```
  >      SELECT columns FROM table AS t1 INNER JOIN table AS t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;
  >      ```
  > 
  > 9. **Join without using JOIN keywords:**
  >    - Implicitly joins tables based on specified conditions.
  >    - Example:
  >      ```
  >      SELECT artist_name, album_name, year_recorded FROM artist, album WHERE artist.id = album.artist_id;
  >      ```
  > 
  >   These methods are used to combine data from multiple tables in SQL queries.

### Explain all about SET Operations in SQL
     
  > **SET OPERATIONS:** These operations are useful for combining and comparing data from multiple tables in SQL queries.
  > 1. Used to combine results from multiple SELECT statements.
  > 
  > 2. Always returns distinct rows.
  > 
  > 3. **UNION:**
  >    - Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements.
  >    - Example:
  >      ```
  >      SELECT * FROM table1
  >      UNION
  >      SELECT * FROM table2;
  >      ```
  >    - Note: Number of columns and their order must be the same in both SELECT statements.
  > 
  > 4. **INTERSECT:**
  >    - Returns common values between two tables.
  >    - Emulated with INNER JOIN:
  >      ```
  >      SELECT DISTINCT column-list FROM table-1 INNER JOIN table-2 USING(join_cond);
  >      ```
  >    - Example:
  >      ```
  >      SELECT DISTINCT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 USING(id);
  >      ```
  > 
  > 5. **MINUS:**
  >    - Returns rows from the first table that do not exist in the second table.
  >    - Emulated with LEFT JOIN and WHERE condition:
  >      ```
  >      SELECT column_list FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON condition WHERE table2.column_name IS NULL;
  >      ```
  >    - Example:
  >      ```
  >      SELECT id FROM table-1 LEFT JOIN table-2 USING(id) WHERE table-2.id IS NULL;
  >      ```

### What is a subquery and how does it differ from a join?
> A subquery is a query nested within another query. It is used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data to be retrieved. Unlike joins, which combine columns from multiple tables, subqueries can be used to filter rows from a single table.


### What are the main clauses where subqueries can be used?
 > Subqueries can be used in the following clauses:
 > 1. Inside a WHERE clause.
 >  > ```sql
 > SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE col1 IN (SELECT col1 FROM table1);
 > ```
 > This query selects all rows from `table1` where `col1` is present in the result of the inner subquery.
 > 
 > 2. Inside a FROM clause.
 >  ```sql
 > SELECT MAX(rating) FROM (SELECT * FROM movie WHERE country = 'India') as temp;
 > ```
 > This query finds the maximum rating from movies where the country is 'India'.
 > A derived subquery, also known as a derived table, is used in the FROM clause. It acts as a temporary table created for the duration of the main query.
 > 
 > 3. Inside a SELECT clause.
 > ```sql
 > SELECT (SELECT column_list(s) FROM T_name WHERE condition), columnList(s) FROM T2_name WHERE condition;
 > ```
 > This query includes a subquery in the SELECT clause to fetch data from `T_name` along with columns from `T2_name`.



### How many types of subqueries are there in SQL based on the number of rows they return?:
 > Subqueries in SQL can also be classified based on the number of rows they return. The main types are:
 >
 > 1. **Single-row Subquery:**
 > A single-row subquery returns only one row of results. It is typically used with comparison operators like `=`, `>`, `<`.
 > 
 > **Example:**
 > ```sql
 > SELECT employee_name 
 > FROM employees 
 > WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
 > ```
 > This query retrieves the name of the employee with the highest salary.
 >
 > 2. **Multiple-row Subquery:**
 > A multiple-row subquery returns more than one row of results. It is typically used with operators like `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`.
 > 
 > **Example:**
 > ```sql
 > SELECT employee_name 
 > FROM employees 
 > WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id 
 >                         FROM departments 
 >                         WHERE location_id = 1700);
 > ```
 > This query retrieves the names of employees who work in departments located in location 1700.
 >
 > 3. **Correlated Subquery:**
 > A correlated subquery references columns from the outer query and is executed once for each row processed by the outer query.
 > 
 > **Example:**
 > ```sql
 > SELECT employee_name 
 > FROM employees e1 
 > WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) 
 >                 FROM employees e2 
 >                 WHERE e1.department_id = e2.department_id);
 > ```
 > This query retrieves the names of employees whose salary is above the average salary of their department.
 >
 > 4. **Nested Subquery:**
 > A nested subquery is a subquery within another subquery. It allows for more complex querying by layering conditions.
 > 
 > **Example:**
 > ```sql
 > SELECT employee_name 
 > FROM employees 
 > WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id 
 >                        FROM departments 
 >                        WHERE manager_id = (SELECT manager_id 
 >                                            FROM managers 
 >                                            WHERE manager_name = 'John Doe'));
 > ```
 > This query retrieves the names of employees who work in the department managed by 'John Doe'.
 > These classifications help in understanding the different ways subqueries can be utilized to handle various data retrieval requirements in SQL.



### What are the restrictions on subqueries in SQL?
 > - A subquery must be enclosed in parentheses.
 > - A subquery must appear on the right side of the comparison operator.
 > - In a WHERE or HAVING clause, a subquery cannot use the ORDER BY clause, but it can be used in subqueries within the FROM clause.

### How can you use subqueries with the EXISTS operator?
 > The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery. It returns true if the subquery returns one or more records.
 > ```sql
 > SELECT name
 > FROM employees e
 > WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM departments d WHERE e.department_id = d.id);
 > ```


### Write a query to find employees who earn more than the average salary of their department.
 > ```sql
 > SELECT name
 > FROM employees e
 > WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e.department_id);
 > ```

### What is the difference between a subquery and a join?
 > A subquery is a query within another query, often used to return a single value or a list of values to be used in the main query. A join combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them, and it typically produces a result set with columns from both tables.
 > Here is the detailed difference between JOIN and Subquery in tabular form:
  
  | Criteria                   | JOIN                                                                                                           | Subquery                                                                                                      |

  | Definition                 | > Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.                                | > A query nested within another query.                                                                        |
  | Usage                      | > Used to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query.                                                | > Used to perform operations that need results from another query.                                            |
  | Syntax                     | > `SELECT columns FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;`                                   | > `SELECT columns FROM table1 WHERE column = (SELECT column FROM table2 WHERE condition);`                    |
  | Performance                | > Generally faster for large datasets as it directly combines tables.                                          | > Can be slower for large datasets as the inner query is executed for each row of the outer query.            |
  | Readability                | > Can be more readable and easier to understand, especially for complex queries involving multiple tables.     | > Can become complex and harder to read when nested deeply.                                                   |
  | Result Set                 | > Produces a result set with columns from both or all joined tables.                                           | > Produces a result set from the outer query, which can be influenced by the result of the subquery.          |

### Explain what MySQL views are and how they are used in database management
    
  > 1. **Definition and Purpose**: MySQL views are virtual tables generated by queries. They do not store data themselves but instead display data from underlying tables or other views. Views are used to simplify complex queries, enforce data security through restricted access, and enhance data organization.
  >
  > 2. **Characteristics**: Views in MySQL mirror the structure of real tables with rows and columns. They provide a way to present subsets of data or transformations of data without altering the original tables.
  >
  > 3. **Advantages**: Views allow for data abstraction, enabling users to work with specific data subsets relevant to their needs without exposing the entire database structure. They can encapsulate complex joins and calculations, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
  >
  > 4. **Syntax and Operations**: Views are created using the `CREATE VIEW` statement, which defines the view's structure based on a `SELECT` query. They can be modified using `ALTER VIEW` and removed using `DROP VIEW`. Views automatically reflect changes in the underlying tables or views they are based on.
  >
  > **Example Answer:**
  >
  > ```sql
  > -- Example: Creating a view to display course details with trainer information
  >
  > CREATE VIEW Trainer AS
  > SELECT c.course_name, c.trainer, t.email
  > FROM courses c
  > JOIN contact t ON c.id = t.id;
  >```
  > In this example, the `Trainer` view is created to show course names, trainers, and their contact emails by joining the `courses` and `contact` tables. Any updates to the `courses` or `contact` tables will automatically reflect in the `Trainer` view, ensuring data consistency.
