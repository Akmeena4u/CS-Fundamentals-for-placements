### What is the primary function of application software?

> Application software performs specific tasks for the user.

### What role does system software play in a computer system?

> System software operates and controls the computer system and provides a platform to run application software.

### How does an operating system manage computer resources?

> An operating system manages all the resources of a computer system, both hardware and software, and provides an environment in which the user can execute their programs in a convenient and efficient manner by hiding the underlying complexity of the hardware and acting as a resource manager.

### What are some potential issues if there were no operating system?

> 
1. Bulky and complex applications, as hardware interaction code must be included in the application's code base.
2. Resource exploitation by a single application.
3. No memory protection.

### What constitutes an operating system?

> An operating system is made up of a collection of system software.

### What functions does an operating system perform?

> An operating system performs several functions:
> - Access to the computer hardware.
> - Acts as an interface between the user and the computer hardware.
> - Manages resources (memory, devices, files, security, processes, etc.) through arbitration.
> - Hides the underlying complexity of the hardware through abstraction.
> - Facilitates the execution of application programs by providing isolation and protection.

### How does an operating system provide a proper use of resources in a computer system?

> The operating system provides the means for the proper use of the resources in the operation of the computer system.

### Describe the relationship between the user, application programs, the operating system, and computer hardware.

> The user interacts with application programs, which in turn rely on the operating system to interact with the computer hardware. The operating system serves as an intermediary, managing resources and providing a stable environment for applications to run.
