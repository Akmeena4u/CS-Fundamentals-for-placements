### Explain the Operating system, its goals & Functions.
> An operating system is a system software that manages all the resources of a computer system, both hardware and software and provides an environment in which the user can execute their programs in a convenient and efficient manner by hiding the underlying complexity of the hardware and acting as a resource manager.
> **OS Goals**
> The primary goals of an operating system are maximum CPU utilization, less process starvation, and higher priority job execution.
> **OS Functions**
> An operating system performs several functions:
> - Access to the computer hardware.
> - Acts as an interface between the user and the computer hardware.
> - Manages resources (memory, devices, files, security, processes, etc.) through arbitration.
> - Hides the underlying complexity of the hardware through abstraction.
> - Facilitates the execution of application programs by providing isolation and protection.

### What are some potential issues if there were no operating system?
> 1. Bulky and complex applications, as hardware interaction code must be included in the application's code base.
> 2. Resource exploitation by a single application.
> 3. No memory protection.

### What are the types of operating systems mentioned?

>
> **Single process OS**
> - A single-process operating system allows only one process to execute at a time from the ready queue. This is the oldest type of operating system.
>- Example- MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System)
>  
> **Batch processing OS**
>- In a batch-processing operating system, the user prepares their job using punch cards and submits it to the computer operator. The operator collects jobs from different  
   users and sorts them into batches based on similar needs. These batches are then submitted to the processor one by one, with all jobs in a batch being executed together.  
   However, this system has several disadvantages. It does not allow for setting priorities if a job has higher importance, which can lead to starvation if a batch takes too 
   long to complete. Additionally, the CPU may become idle during I/O operations.
> - Example: ATLAS, Manchester Univ., late 1950s	–	early 1960s

>
> **Multiprogramming OS**
> - A multiprogramming operating system increases CPU utilization by keeping multiple jobs (code and data) in memory, ensuring that the CPU always has a job to execute if another job gets busy with I/O operations. This system involves a single CPU and utilizes context switching for processes, where the switch occurs when the current process goes into the wait state. As a result, the CPU's idle time is significantly reduced.
> - Example: THE, Dijkstra, early 1960s
>
> **Multitasking OS**
> - Multitasking is a logical extension of multiprogramming that involves a single CPU with the capability to run more than one task simultaneously. It utilizes context-switching and time-sharing techniques to manage multiple tasks, leading to increased responsiveness and further reduced CPU idle time.
> - Example: CTSS, MIT, early 1960s
>
>**Multiprogramming OS**
> - A multiprogramming operating system offers several advantages, including the use of more than one CPU in a single computer, which increases reliability as other CPUs can continue working if one fails. This setup results in better throughput and reduces process starvation, as multiple CPUs can handle additional processes if one CPU is busy with a particular task.
> - Example: Windows	NT
>
> **Distributed OS**
> - A distributed operating system is a type of system software that manages and coordinates resources across multiple interconnected computers via network. these interconnected nodes works together as a unified system
> - Example: Google's Kubernetes, LOCUS
>
>**RTOS**
> - Real-Time Operating System. It is an operating system designed to handle tasks with strict timing requirements. In an RTOS, tasks have deadlines that must be met, these are used in scenarios like air traffic control systems and robots.
> - Example: ATCS


### What is the difference between a program, process, and thread?
> - **Program:** A program is an executable file containing instructions, stored on disk and ready for execution.
> - **Process:** A process is an instance of a program currently running in memory (RAM).
> - **Thread:** A thread is a Lightweight process with An independent path of execution in a process. it is Used to achieve parallelism by dividing a process’s tasks which are independent execution paths.

### What is the concept of multitasking and multithreading?**
> - **Multitasking:** In multitasking, multiple tasks (or processes) are executed simultaneously by the operating system, utilizing context switching(Context switching involves saving and restoring the entire state of the process) between processes to share CPU resources.
> - **Multithreading:** Multithreading involves dividing a process into multiple threads, each with its own execution path. Threads within the same process share memory and resources, allowing for parallel execution of tasks within a single program. such as handling multiple tabs in a browser or performing various operations in a text editor simultaneously.

### What are the differences in memory management and isolation between processes and threads?**
> - **Processes:** Each process has its own memory space and resources allocated by the operating system, providing isolation and memory protection.
> - **Threads:** Threads within the same process share the same memory space and resources allocated to the process, lacking isolation. They can access shared data directly, which can simplify communication but requires careful synchronization to avoid conflicts.

### What is Context switching?
> Context switching is the process of saving the state of a currently running process or thread so that it can be resumed later, while loading the state of another process or thread to run in its place. This operation is crucial in multitasking operating systems where multiple processes or threads compete for CPU time.
> It is faster in threads as it does not require switching memory address space. and It is slower in processes compared to thread context switching due to the overhead of switching memory contexts and state restoration.


### Explain about Components of OS
> The components of an operating system (OS) are essential parts that collectively manage and facilitate the interaction between hardware, software, and users. Each component plays a crucial role in ensuring the efficient operation of the computer system.
> 
> **1. Kernel**
> The kernel is the core component of the operating system. It interacts directly with the hardware and manages the fundamental operations of the system.
> 
> **Types of Kernels**
> Operating systems may employ different types of kernels, each with its advantages and trade-offs:
> - **Monolithic Kernel:** Includes all OS services (process management, file system, device drivers) in a single kernel space. It provides fast communication between components but can be complex and less modular. Examples include Linux and Unix.
> - **Microkernel:** Keeps core functions like process and memory management within the kernel space, while higher-level functions like file systems and device drivers run in user space. It offers better modularity and stability but may have lower performance due to frequent mode switches. Examples include MINIX and L4.
> - **Hybrid Kernel:** Combines aspects of both monolithic and microkernel designs, aiming for a balance between performance and modularity. It retains critical services in kernel space while moving others to user space for better security and stability. Examples include macOS and Windows NT/7/10.
> - 
>  Key functions of the kernel include:
> - **Process Management:** Handles the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes and threads. It ensures efficient allocation of CPU time and resources.
> - **Memory Management:** Manages physical and virtual memory allocation, ensuring each process has enough memory to execute without interference from other processes.
> - **File Management:** Provides mechanisms for creating, accessing, and organizing files and directories. It handles file permissions, security, and storage allocation.
> - **I/O Management:** Controls input and output operations, including communication with peripherals such as keyboards, mice, printers, and network devices. It ensures efficient data transfer and device management.
> 
> **2. User Space**
> User space is where application software runs. Applications in user space do not have direct access to hardware resources but interact with the kernel through system calls to perform tasks. User space includes:
> - **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Provides a visual way for users to interact with the computer system using icons, windows, menus, and pointers (mouse).
> - **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Allows users to interact with the system by typing commands into a terminal or shell, which are then interpreted and executed by the operating system.

### How do applications from Userspace interact with the kernel in an operating system?**
> Applications interact with the kernel through system calls. These calls provide a way for user programs to request services from the kernel that they do not have permission to perform directly. For example, when an application like `mkdir` (make directory) is invoked, it indirectly calls the kernel's file management module to create a new directory.
> System calls are typically implemented in C and are part of the operating system's kernel. Each system call corresponds to a specific function within the kernel that performs the requested operation. For example, in Unix-based systems, `fork()` is used to create a new process

### Can you explain the types of system calls commonly used in operating systems?**
> A: System calls are categorized into several types based on the services they provide:
> 
> - **Process Control:** Includes operations like creating processes, terminating processes, and managing process attributes (e.g., `fork()` , `exit()`
`wait()` in Unix, `CreateProcess()` in Windows).
> - **File Management:** Involves creating, deleting, reading, writing, and managing file attributes (e.g., `open()`, `read()`, `write()` `close ()`
`chmod()` , `umask()`, `chown()` in Unix).
> - **Device Management:** Handles operations related to device access, such as requesting or releasing devices and managing device attributes (e.g., `ioctl()`, `ReadConsole()`, `read()` , `write()` in Unix).
> - **Information Maintenance:** Provides access to system data, process information, and system time (e.g., `getpid()`, `alarm()` , `sleep ()` in Unix).
> - **Communication Management:** Deals with creating communication connections, sending/receiving messages, and managing communication status (e.g., `pipe()`, `shmget()` in Unix).

### How does inter-process communication (IPC) occur between processes in an operating system?**
> - **IPC:** Inter-process communication enables communication between independent processes running in their own memory spaces. Methods include shared memory and message passing, allowing processes to exchange data and synchronize actions while maintaining memory protection and security boundaries.


### What happens when you turn on your computer?
> When you switch on a computer, several key processes occur sequentially:
>
> 1. **BIOS Activation and POST (Power On Self Test):**
>    - When the power button is pressed, the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) is the first chipset to activate.
>    - BIOS performs a Power On Self Test (POST) to check if essential hardware components like keyboard, RAM, and disk drives are functioning properly.
>    - It provides audible beep codes to indicate the status of these components.
>
> 2. **Boot Sequence and MBR (Master Boot Record):**
>    - BIOS initiates the boot sequence by identifying a storage device (usually a hard drive or SSD) based on its configured boot order.
>    - It loads the Master Boot Record (MBR), located in the first 512 bytes of the storage device.
>    - The MBR contains a partition table that identifies bootable partitions.
>
> 3. **Bootloader Execution:**
>    - Once the bootable partition is identified, BIOS hands over control to the bootloader stored in the partition's first 512 bytes.
>    - Popular bootloaders include GRUB or LILO for Linux, and the Windows Bootloader for Windows OS.
>    - The bootloader's role is to load the operating system kernel into the computer's RAM.
> 4. **Kernel Initialization:**
>    - The kernel (e.g., Linux kernel or Windows NT kernel) is loaded into RAM by the bootloader.
>    - It performs a series of tasks, including auto-probing to ensure hardware functionality (e.g., WiFi, hard drives).
>    - System daemons (background services like networking) are started by the kernel.
>
> 5. **GUI or Display Manager Start:**
>    - Finally, the kernel initializes the Graphical User Interface (GUI) or Display Manager, which presents the login screen.
>    - Users interact with this interface to log in and access the computer's functionalities.
>
> This sequential process, starting from BIOS activation to GUI initialization, ensures that the computer boots up and is ready for user interaction.
