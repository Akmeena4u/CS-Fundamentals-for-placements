### Explain about Computer and its components 
> - A computer is an electronic device that can perform a variety of tasks by executing programmed instructions. These tasks can include calculations, data processing, and  
> automated reasoning.
> - Computers are composed of hardware and software components, where the hardware refers to the physical parts, and the software includessystem software( operating system (OS))  and application software that runs on it.
> Application software performs specific tasks for the user.
> System software operates and controls the computer system and provides a platform to run application software.

### Describe the relationship between all computer components.
>The components of a computer system work together in an interconnected and interdependent manner. This collaboration ensures the smooth operation and functionality of the computer. Here's an overview of how these components relate to each other:
> The user interacts with application programs, which in turn rely on the operating system to interact with the computer hardware. The operating system serves as an intermediary, managing resources and providing a stable environment for applications to run.

### Explain the Operating system and its Functions.
> An operating system is a system software that manages all the resources of a computer system, both hardware and software and provides an environment in which the user can execute their programs in a convenient and efficient manner by hiding the underlying complexity of the hardware and acting as a resource manager.
> **OS Functions**
> An operating system performs several functions:
> - Access to the computer hardware.
> - Acts as an interface between the user and the computer hardware.
> - Manages resources (memory, devices, files, security, processes, etc.) through arbitration.
> - Hides the underlying complexity of the hardware through abstraction.
> - Facilitates the execution of application programs by providing isolation and protection.

### What are some potential issues if there were no operating system?
> 1. Bulky and complex applications, as hardware interaction code must be included in the application's code base.
> 2. Resource exploitation by a single application.
> 3. No memory protection.
