### What is OSI model in computer networking.
>- The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to understand and describe how different networking systems communicate with each other. Created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984, the OSI Model divides the communication process into seven distinct layers. Each layer has a specific role, ensuring that different technologies and products can work together smoothly.
> - The OSI model consists of seven ordered layers. Each layer communicates with its adjacent layers, following specific protocols, to ensure efficient and reliable data transmission.
> -  Each layer communicates with its peer layer on another device, following standardized protocols.

### Explain 7 layers of OSI Model
> **1. Physical Layer**
> - **Definition:** The Physical Layer is the lowest layer of the OSI Model, concerned with transmitting raw bit streams over a physical medium.
> - **Function:** It manages the physical connection between devices, defining specifications such as voltage levels, pin layout, and physical medium characteristics (cables, fibers, wireless frequencies).
> - **Crucial Components:** Network hubs, repeaters, cables (twisted-pair, fiber-optic), connectors.
> - **Example Protocols:** Ethernet, RS-232, USB, HDMI.
> 
> **2. Data Link Layer**
> - **Definition:** The Data Link Layer provides error-free transfer of data frames between directly connected nodes.
> - **Function:** It packages raw bits into frames, adds physical addresses (MAC addresses), and detects/corrects errors that may occur at the Physical Layer.
> - **Crucial Components:** Switches, network interface cards (NICs), bridges.
> - **Example Protocols:** Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol).
> 
> **3. Network Layer**
> - **Definition:** The Network Layer handles logical addressing and routing of data packets from the source to the destination across different networks.
> - **Function:** It determines the best path for data to travel (routing) using logical addresses (IP addresses) and manages internetwork communication.
> - **Crucial Components:** Routers, IP addresses.
> - **Example Protocols:** IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).
> 
> **4. Transport Layer**
> - **Definition:** The Transport Layer ensures reliable data transfer between end systems and provides error-checking mechanisms.
> - **Function:** It segments and reassembles data into packets, manages data flow, and provides error detection/correction and sequencing.
> - **Crucial Components:** TCP ports, UDP ports.
> - **Example Protocols:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol), SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol).

> - **Crucial Components:** Session establishment protocols.
> - **Example Protocols:** NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System), PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol), SIP (Session Initiation Protocol).
> 
> **6. Presentation Layer**
> - **Definition:** The Presentation Layer translates, encrypts, and formats data for the application layer.
> - **Function:** It ensures that data sent from the application layer of one system can be properly interpreted by the application layer of another system.
> - **Crucial Components:** Data compression standards, encryption/decryption protocols.
> - **Example Protocols:** SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security), JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).

> - **Crucial Components:** Application-level protocols, APIs.
> - **Example Protocols:** HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), DNS (Domain Name System).
> 
> Each layer of the OSI Model plays a crucial role in ensuring effective communication and interoperability between different systems and networks. Understanding these layers helps in designing, troubleshooting, and optimizing network architectures and protocols.

### Explain Data flows through the OSI model in a step-by-step process
> Application Layer: Applications create the data.
> Presentation Layer: Data is formatted and encrypted.
> Session Layer: Connections are established and managed.
> Transport Layer: Data is broken into segments for reliable delivery.
> Network Layer: Segments are packaged into packets and routed.
> Data Link Layer: Packets are framed and sent to the next device.
> Physical Layer: Frames are converted into bits and transmitted physically.

### What is switching in computer networking, and why is it important?
>- Switching in computer networking refers to the process of transferring data packets from one device to another within a network, or from one network to another, using specialized hardware devices called switches. This process occurs at the Data Link layer of the OSI Model and is crucial for efficient network communication.
>  
> There are primarily three types of switching methods:
>
> -![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd67185d-5a89-4ad1-ab7c-8414c74869da)
>
> 1. **Message Switching:** This older technique involves transmitting entire messages across a network. It is inefficient because messages are forwarded through multiple nodes, leading to delays and increased network load. Message switching is no longer widely used due to its inefficiency.
> 
> 2. **Circuit Switching:**
> -In circuit switching, a dedicated connection or circuit is established between the source and destination before data transmission begins. This connection remains active for the duration of the communication session, ensuring a consistent bandwidth allocation. While efficient for continuous data streams, circuit switching can be less flexible for sporadic data transmissions. The traditional telephone system is a classic example of circuit switching, where a physical circuit is allocated for the duration of a call.
>    - **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)** : In Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), multiple signals are combined into a single signal by allocating each signal a specific time slot within a fixed time frame.
>    - **frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)**: Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) involves combining multiple signals into a single composite signal by dividing the available bandwidth into distinct frequency bands. Each signal is allocated a separate frequency band, allowing them to coexist without interference.
> 
> 4. **Packet Switching:** Packet switching breaks data into smaller units called packets or frames. Each packet contains information such as source and destination addresses, allowing routers and switches to independently route them through the network. The internet uses packet switching where data is split into packets that travel independently and are reassembled at the destination. Packet switching can be further classified into:
>    - **Datagram Packet Switching:** Each packet is treated independently, and routes are determined dynamically based on network conditions. This method offers flexibility but may result in variable delivery times and potential packet loss.
>    - **Virtual-Circuit Packet Switching:** Virtual circuit switching establishes a temporary dedicated path (virtual circuit) between sender and receiver, similar to circuit switching. However, it dynamically allocates resources and routes packets like packet switching once the virtual circuit is established.
> 
> Each switching method has its advantages and is suited to different network requirements, ranging from traditional telephony (circuit switching) to modern data networks (packet switching).
