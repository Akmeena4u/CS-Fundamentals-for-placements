### What is Computer Networks
> A computer network is an interconnected telecommunications network, that allows autonomous digital devices(such as laptops, desktops, servers, and an ever-expanding array of IoT devices ) to exchange data with each other using either wired or wireless connections to share resources (h/w or s/w) interconnected by a single technology e.g. internet.

### What are the Goals of Computer Networks?
> - **Facilitating Communication:** Computer networks enable swift and efficient communication through tools like video conferencing, emails, and instant messaging
> - **Resource Sharing:** Computer networks allow users to share hardware (like printers) and software resources (such as files and applications)
> - **Data Storage and Access:** Computer networks provide centralized storage systems that enable data access from any connected device. that Helps in easy data backup and recovery.
> **Cost Efficiency:** By sharing resources and avoiding duplication of hardware and software, computer networks reduce operational costs.


### What is the difference between the Internet and the Web?
> The Internet is a global network of interconnected networks, serving as the infrastructure that enables communication and data exchange between devices worldwide. It supports various protocols like TCP and UDP for diverse types of applications.
>
> On the other hand, the Web, formally known as the World Wide Web (WWW), is a collection of information accessible via the Internet. It is built on top of the Internet infrastructure and utilizes the HTTP protocol layered over TCP for transferring web content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



### What are the five components of a data communication system, and how do they contribute to effective communication?
> A data communication system comprises five essential components:
>
> 1. **Message:** This refers to the information (data) being transmitted, which can include text, audio, video, or any other form of data.
> 2. **Sender:** The sender is the device or entity that initiates and sends the message. It could be a computer, phone, camera, or any other device capable of generating data.
> 3. **Receiver:** The receiver is the device or entity that accepts and processes the message sent by the sender. Examples include computers, phones, televisions, etc.
> 4. **Transmission Medium:** This is the physical pathway through which the message travels from the sender to the receiver. It can be wired (e.g., optical fibers, copper cables) or wireless (e.g., radio waves, microwave transmission).
> 5. **Protocol:** The protocol defines the rules and conventions governing communication, including syntax (structure of data), semantics (meaning of data), timing (when data is sent and received), and standards (both de facto and de jure). It ensures that devices can communicate effectively by standardizing communication procedures and formats.
>
> Together, these components work collaboratively to facilitate reliable and efficient data communication between devices over various transmission mediums, ensuring that information is transmitted accurately and comprehensible.


### What are the two broad categories of transmission media used in data communication? Describe each category briefly.
> Transmission media are categorized into Guided Media and Unguided Media.
>
> **Guided Media(Wired):** Also known as wired or bounded transmission media, guided media direct signals through a specific physical path. This includes types such as twisted pair cables, coaxial cables, and optical fiber cables. They are suitable for high-speed, secure communication over relatively shorter distances due to their physical confinement of signals within cables.
>
> **Unguided Media(Wireless):** Referred to as wireless or unbounded transmission media, unguided media transmit electromagnetic signals through the air. Examples include radio waves, microwaves, and infrared waves. These signals are broadcasted and can travel longer distances, albeit with lower security compared to guided media.


###  Differentiate between Radio Waves, Microwaves, and Infrared Waves in terms of frequency range, penetration capabilities, and security.
> Here is the difference :
> - **Frequency Range:** Radio waves have the lowest frequencies( 3 KHz to 1 GHz.), followed by microwaves (1 GHz to 300 GHz) and then infrared waves with the highest frequencies(300 GHz to 400 THz.).
> - **Penetration:** Radio waves can penetrate solid objects depending on frequency, microwaves require line-of-sight, and infrared waves do not penetrate solid objects.
> - **Security:** Radio waves offer poor security due to interception risks, microwaves provide medium security, and infrared waves offer higher security by limiting interference between systems.

### Give me  real-world uses of Radio, microwaves, and infrared waves.
>Here is the applications: 
> - **Radio:** Used for long-distance communication, broadcasting (radio and television), radar, and wireless networking (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.).
> - **Microwaves:** Microwaves are used in microwave ovens for cooking food, satellite communications, radar, wireless networking (like Wi-Fi routers operating in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands), and certain types of short-range data transmission.
> - **Infrared:** Infrared waves are commonly used in remote controls (for TVs, stereos, etc.), thermal imaging (night vision cameras), and some types of short-range communication.


###  What are the three types of data transmission modes? Describe each mode with an example.
> Data transmission modes are categorized into Simplex, Half Duplex, and Full Duplex.
>
> - **Simplex:** In simplex mode, data flows in only one direction, allowing communication in a unidirectional manner. One device can only send data, and the other can only receive. For Example A radio broadcast where the receiver can only listen but cannot send signals back.
> - **Half Duplex:** Both devices can transmit and receive data, but not simultaneously. They take turns using the communication channel. For Example Walkie-talkies where one person talks while the other listens, and then they switch roles.
> - **Full Duplex:** Both devices can transmit and receive data simultaneously, allowing for two-way communication. For example Telephone conversations where both parties can speak and listen at the same time over the same line.


### Explain about all network topologies.
>Network topologies refer to the physical or logical layout of connected devices in a computer network. Each topology defines how nodes (devices like computers, servers, printers) are interconnected and how data flows between them. Here are the main types of network topologies:

>
> **Mesh Topology:**
> - **Description:** Every device connects to every other device with dedicated point-to-point links, ensuring high redundancy.
> - **Advantages:** No traffic problems, robustness, privacy, and easy fault isolation.
> - **Disadvantages:** Difficult installation and expensive due to extensive cabling.
>   
> **Star Topology:**
> - **Description:** Devices connect to a central hub, facilitating easy installation and management.
> - **Advantages:** Cost-effective, easy to install/reconfigure, and robust with fault isolation.
> - **Disadvantages:** Dependency on the central hub and potential for increased cabling.
>   
> **Bus Topology:**
> - **Description:** Uses a single central cable (bus) to connect all devices, simplifying installation.
> - **Advantages:** Cost-effective, easy to install, and requires less cabling.
> - **Disadvantages:** Difficult fault isolation, challenging to add new devices, and single point of failure.
>   
> **Ring Topology:**
> - **Description:** Each device connects to two neighbors, forming a closed loop where data circulates.
> - **Advantages:** Easy to install, fault isolation is simplified.
> - **Disadvantages:** A break in the ring can disable the entire network.




### What are the key differences between LAN, WAN, and MAN?
> LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), and MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) are types of networks distinguished primarily by their geographical coverage, scale, and the types of services they support. Here are the key differences:
> - **LAN (Local Area Network):**
> LAN typically covers a small geographic area, such as a building or campus. Often privately owned, used for office or building-wide networking.
> **Example:** A LAN can include computers within a single office floor or an entire building.
>
> - **WAN (Wide Area Network):** WAN spans a large geographic area, connecting multiple LANs and other networks.Encompasses networks across cities, states, or even countries.
> **Example:** The network covering the entire state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) qualifies as a WAN.
>
> - **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):**  MAN falls between LAN and WAN in size, covering a larger area than LAN but smaller than WAN. Typically encompasses a city or metropolitan area.
> **Example:** The network infrastructure across Mumbai serves as a MAN.

### Differentiate between Unicast, Broadcast, and Multicast in computer networking.
>In computer networking, Unicast, Broadcast, and Multicast are methods used for transmitting data packets to multiple destinations. Here’s how they differ:
> - **Unicast:** Unicast sends data from one sender to one receiver, ensuring point-to-point communication. Like Sending an email to a specific recipient’s email address.
> - **Broadcast:** Broadcast sends data from one sender to all devices within a network, ensuring widespread delivery. Like Broadcasting a network status update to all computers in a LAN.
> - **Multicast:** Multicast sends data from one sender to a specific group of recipients, optimizing bandwidth usage. Like Streaming a live video feed to multiple users simultaneously over the internet.
