#### 1. What is OOPs?
> **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** OOPs in C++ is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Languages such as Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript support OOP by allowing the creation of classes that specify attributes and methods It focuses on using classes and objects to model real-world entities and their interactions. The four main principles of OOP are:
> 
> **Basic principles of OOPs:**
> - **Inheritance:** Allows new classes to inherit properties and methods from existing classes, promoting code reuse and hierarchical relationships.
> - **Encapsulation:** Encapsulates data and methods within objects, ensuring data security and integrity by exposing only necessary components.
> - **Polymorphism:** Provides the ability to define methods in multiple forms, enabling objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.
> - **Abstraction:** Simplifies complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem, hiding unnecessary details and exposing only essential features.


#### 2. Difference between Procedural Programming and OOPs?
  
| **Feature**                | **Procedural Programming**                       | **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**          |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**               | Based on functions                              | Based on real-world objects                    |
| **Data Handling**          | Shows data to the entire program                | Encapsulates data                              |
| **Code Reusability**       | Lacks scope for code reuse                      | Provides greater scope for code reuse          |
| **Programming Paradigm**   | Follows a top-down programming paradigm         | Follows a bottom-up programming paradigm       |
| **Complexity**             | Complicated in nature, harder to modify, extend, and maintain | Less complicated, easier to modify, extend, and maintain |

#### 3. Why use OOPs?
> **Reasons to use OOPs:**
> 
> - **Modularity:** OOP promotes modular design, making it easier to divide complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
> - **Reusability:** Classes and objects can be used repeatedly in different parts of a program or other programs, saving time and making programs more efficient.
> - **Encapsulation:** Hides the inner workings of an object and only shows what’s necessary, keeping things secure and preventing accidental changes.
> - **Inheritance:** Allows creating new classes based on existing ones, aiding in code reuse and building organized relationships between classes.
> - **Polymorphism:** Enables different objects to be treated as part of the same group, making software more flexible and easier to expand.
> - **Abstraction:** Simplifies real-world entities into easier-to-understand models, focusing on what’s essential and hiding unnecessary details.
